# Pioupiou for Developers

Welcome to the Pioupiou developers portal.

Pioupiou is build from the beginning with the idea of making it's data available in an open and easily reusable way.

We believe that the value is not the data, but the innovative uses **you** will create from it.

## API endpoints

### Measurements
* [Live] : latest measurements
* [Archive] : historical data
* [Push] : real-time feed using [Socket.IO]
