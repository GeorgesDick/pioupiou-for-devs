# Data Licensing

If you want to access the measurements of your own station, go ahead ! You own it so you can do whatever you want with it.

If you want to access the measurements from every Pioupiou stations, we provide 2 different licenses :

* The **Community License** is free (and will ever be). It fits projects with open data in mind.
* The **Extended License** is more liberal. It is custom tailored to your needs.
